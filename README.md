# unixscripts

This repository contains various scripts for Unix-like-Systems (including GNU, even if it's not Unix; most scripts would even run on Cygwin and friends). They cover system administation tasks, multimedia tasks and more. These scripts are frequently used by myself and I published them on Github to let others benefit and to make installing them on new systems easier for me (believe me, I really often install new systems (mainly GNU/Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD)).

# Installation #

First you need git software on the system. In Debian and derivates it's enough to install package "git" using "apt-get install git".
